# About Me

## Lab 01

In this lab I was able to complete the stretch goal by implementing .map(). With the array that was given the .map() will iterate throught he array and pass the information as props into the Horned Beast Component.

## Lab 02

**Number and name of feature:** #1 Display images

**Estimate of time needed to complete:** 10min

**Start time:** 2:06pm

**Finish time:** 2:08pm

**Actual time needed to complete:** 2 min to complete due to having base code already implemented; Used json file instead of own animal array.

**Number and name of feature:** #2 Allow user to vote for their favorite Beast

**Estimate of time needed to complete:** 30min

**Start time:** 2:10pm

**Finish time:** 2:22pm

**Actual time needed to complete:** 12 min to complete.

**Number and name of feature:** #3 Bootstrap

**Estimate of time needed to complete:** 20min

**Start time:** 2:25pm

**Finish time:** 3:00pm

**Actual time needed to complete:** 35 min to complete. Took time to figure out what exactly I wanted from React-BootStrap

**Number and name of feature:** #4 Stretch

For the stretch goal today I added an event listener on click onto the image title that will change the class name of the description text. When clicked the class will be updated and take on a bigger font size/ font weight helping readability. Clicking again will revert back to the origin class and change the text back to its original size

## Lab 03

**Number and name of feature:** #1 Display a Modal

**Estimate of time needed to complete:** 1 hour

**Start time:** 2:11pm

**Finish time:** 3:00pm

**Actual time needed to complete:** 49 min to complete. Next time might be better to fully plan the flow before coding

**Number and name of feature:** #2 Stretch
After a lot of research I was able to create a fuzzy search bar that updates per keypress

## Lab 04

**Number and name of feature:** Filter by Number of Horns

**Estimate of time needed to complete:** 1 hour

**Start time:** 3:30pm

**Finish time:** 4:30pm

**Actual time needed to complete:** 1 hour to complete

Since I already implemented forms in my previous stretch goal adding in another was easier. One thing that I would like to look into more is getting both the filtering options to work off each other.
