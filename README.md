In this lab I was able to complete the stretch goal by implementing .map(). With the array that was given the .map() will iterate throught he array and pass the information as props into the Horned Beast Component.

**Number and name of feature:** #4 Stretch

For the stretch goal today I added an event listener on click onto the image title that will change the class name of the description text. When clicked the class will be updated and take on a bigger font size/ font weight helping readability. Clicking again will revert back to the origin class and change the text back to its original size
